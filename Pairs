Given an integer 'k' and an array of integers 'arr', write a function 'pairs' that returns the number of pairs of integers in 'arr' that have a difference of 'k'. The function should have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of 'arr'.

Example:

Input:
k = 2
arr = [1, 3, 2, 1]

Output:
2
Explanation:

The pairs with a difference of 2 are (1, 3) and (2, 1). So, the function should return 2.

Note: The order of the pairs does not matter. For example, both (1, 3) and (3, 1) are considered the same pair.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5, where n is the length of 'arr'
-10^4 <= arr[i] <= 10^4, for all i in the range [0, n-1]
